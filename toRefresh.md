# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

1. Wrote double instead of float first
2. ArrayList<> should be arraylist(String)
3. Looked up java methods to find set()
4. Looked up java collections sort
5. changed ArrayList .. = New ArrayList<String>(); to List .. = New ArrayList<String>();
6. added <String> to List .. = New ArrayList<String>(); so it's now List<String> .. = New ArrayList<String>(); (had to look up)
7. had to change /n to \n
8. had to look up to how set a size for an array
9. had to look up why toString() wasnt working for myArray.toString(). turns out its Arrays.toString(myArray);
10. had to look up and make sure i was right in using .contains() to find substring and not another method i didn't think of
11. had to look up method that joins strings without using a loop and .concat
12. found out set could not print element at index so put my set items into an array then iterated. however don't know how i would convert set to a list then iterate.
13. HashMap does not have order
14. had to look up myMap.put("existingKey", newValueNum) replaces value but not key (so no duplicate keys in a map)
15. looked up info about constructor as well as toString() method. made sure to know if i include static, void
16. how to convert int to string to use a method like toString() but for ints
17. had to search up @param meaning in java to understand how to then use it in birthYear()
18. struggled a bit to remember the order of the syntax when making a new object variable (Object objectName = new Object(String s, int n)) for example
19. learned that it's still considered a local variable if you make it in the main method (i thought i had to make a method inside the main method when working on the get name problem).
